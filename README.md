# Project Name

ft_transcendence is the last project in the 42 Common Core, which is about creating a website for the mighty Pong contest!
The project is consisting of three main parts (user interface, chat, and real-time multiplayer online games)

1- The user interface is where a user can log in to their profile and perform actions such as navigation, adding/removing friends, and posting content

2- Chat is where you can start a direct message with your friends, create channelsâ€”public, private, or protected with a passwordâ€”and engage in conversations with your friends.

3- Game: This section represents the core goal of the project, providing you with the opportunity to play ping pong with your friends.

## Technologies Used

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) - A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications. Leveraging TypeScript, NestJS follows the modular development pattern and supports various libraries for seamless integration.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features, enhancing code maintainability and scalability.
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, maintained by Facebook. ReactJS allows for the creation of interactive and reusable UI components in a declarative style.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - A modern database toolkit that simplifies database access and management, providing a type-safe and auto-generated query builder.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - A powerful, open-source relational database system used for data storage.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - A platform for automating the deployment and scaling of applications in lightweight, portable containers.

## Installation

## My tasks : 
1- First :

I took charge of the project from the start, organizing tasks and making a plan. I not only listed what needed to be done but also worked on a detailed plan using UML class diagrams. These diagrams helped us visualize the project structure and relationships between different parts. It was like drawing a map to guide us through the project. This combination of planning and visualizing set us on the right path to success.

2-Second :

After the first step of the conception of the project, I took an extra step by creating different data models using Prisma to organize and structure our database, specifically with PostgreSQL. This involved setting up a blueprint for how our information gets stored and connected. 

3-Third :

In addition, I added a feature to the project: real-time chat. Basically, I made it so people can talk to each other instantly. I used NestJS and WebSocket to make it work smoothly and quickly. And to keep all those chat messages in order, I saved them neatly in a PostgreSQL database. Think of it like having a secure and organized place to store all the conversations, making sure everything runs smoothly and stays organized in our project.
